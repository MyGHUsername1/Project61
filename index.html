        Here are some of my favorite dishes to cook (and eat!):

        <p>Pasta is one of my favorite foods! The creamy sauce, the buttery noodles, the way the flavors marry, what's not to love?</p>
        <br>

        <p>Moving on to something less refined, but just a mouth-watering, samosa! These delicious, filed to the brim puffs are impossible to put down! You literally cannot eat just one.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Last, but NOT least, mint! I love ANYTHING mint-flavored, mint-colored, or even mint-scented! This refreshing herb will go eith anything, as a garnish to brighten you dish, or as the star of the show.</p>

    <section id="My Recommendations">
        <h1>My Recommendations</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I already mentioned I like to watch cooking shows, right? Well, here are the best ones you MUST watch:
            <br>
            The Best Leftovers Ever: I recently started this one, but I love it! These chefs have some SERIOUS talent, in my opinon, more the ones on other shows.
            <br>
            Crazy Delicious: This one was so fun to watch! I love how you have truly famous chefs as hilarious judges!
            <br>
            Nadiya's Time To Eat: I loved this show! Nadiya makes an awesome host, and her hacks are just genius!

        <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> My favorite hobby is cooking. When we are free, me and my mom will head to the kitchen to go whip up some snacks.
            <br>
            Learning and developing food skills is very important. If there is no one to cook for you, and you can't get takeout, what will you do?
            <br>
            Well, that's where the cooking comes in. If you can create incredible dishes, your guests will be amazed! And cooking is an awesome career, too!
            <br>
            If you decide to become a culinary artist, you may get the chance to get on TV, and cook for famous personalities.
            You may even become one yourself!
            <br>
            That's why I like to cook. The next time you're in your kitchen, try making an exquisite meal. Who knows? Maybe you'll become a Michelin Star award-winning chef!
